Last Updated : 19 Dec, 2024
Given a matrix mat[][] and an integer x, the task is to check if x is present in mat[][] or not. Every row and column of the matrix is sorted in increasing order.

Examples:

Input: x = 62, mat[][] = [[3, 30, 38],
                            [20, 52, 54],
                            [35, 60, 69]]
Output: false
Explanation: 62 is not present in the matrix.
